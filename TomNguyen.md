Hi, my name is **Tom Nguyen**. I'm in my fourth year at **ANU** doing a bachelor's degree in **Advanced Computer Science**, with a specialization in **Machine Learning**.

I love programming, but outside of that, I enjoy doing other hobbies such as:
- Singing
- Playing chess
- Learning Vietnamese
- Playing Magic the Gathering

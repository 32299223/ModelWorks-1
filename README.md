<h2 style="font-size: 24px;"> Purpose of Branch 🌀</h2>  

<p style="font-size: 16px;">  
For now, this is a demonstration of the planned GUI of the framework in its most basic form (so lacking most functionality apart from talking with an LLM).  This will be eventually refactored into catering to the other features of the framework, but will still be available for use.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px;"> 👾 How to Use </h2>  

<p style="font-size: 16px;">  
Run the following in your terminal:
 
* `chmod +x init.sh`
* `./init.sh`

And then view the GUI on `localhost:3000`.
